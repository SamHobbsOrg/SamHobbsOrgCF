<h1>About Me</h1>

<h3>Career</h3>

<p>Many years ago, I was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_mainframe">
IBM Mainframe</a> COBOL programmer. Since then I have been doing C++, C# and
other languages. A few years ago I helped in the
<a href="https://forums.codeguru.com">CodeGuru forums</a> (that site is having
problems). As a result of my volunteer work in the CodeGuru forums, I created
my <a href="http://simplesamples.info">Sam's Simple Samples</a> web site where
I have since put many things for programmers. I have also been involved in the 
following forums.</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft&#39;s
<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/categories">MSDN Forums</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com">C# Corner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>I have been a victim of Asthma. Due to that, many years ago, I often 
went hiking. There was a time many years ago when I could not walk on the sand 
at the beach for more than a few minutes without having to pause and catch my 
breath. When my health began to improve I began going on hikes. I lived close to 
Griffith Park and began walking to Griffith Park. The walk up to the 
observatory was a challenge. When it was no longer a challenge, I began hiking 
up the Arroyo Seco from JPL. When that was no longer a challenge, I began hiking 
up to Strawberry Peak and other hikes. When Strawberry Peak was no longer a 
challenge, I began hiking up the Mount Wilson trail to Mount Wilson. When Mount 
Wilson was no longer as much of a challenge (it is always a challenging hike) I 
began hiking up Mount Baldy from the village. The first time I made it to the 
top of Mount Baldy, I rested a day and then tried to get to the top of Mount 
Whitney. I made it nearly to the top of Mount Whitney but it was late enough 
that I was concerned I would run out of daylight and I did not have a 
flashlight. I made it back to the trailhead just as I lost all sunlight. The 
ultimate challenge is to hike from the Palm Springs Museum to the top of the 
Palm Springs Aerial Tramway. That hike would be a monster hike, much more
of a challenge (over 8,000 foot elevation gain) than the traditional
Mount Whitney hike.</p>
